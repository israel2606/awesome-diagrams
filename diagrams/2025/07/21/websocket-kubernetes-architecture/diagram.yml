  As part of the development efforts on the Mesh Delivery technology at Lumen, this architecture addresses the challenges of implementing a resilient and scalable backend capable of solving WebRTC signaling issues. The solution demonstrates how to build a distributed WebSocket server architecture that can automatically scale on Kubernetes to handle high-throughput, real-time communication requirements.

  The architecture showcases a comprehensive approach to distributed WebSocket management, including load balancing strategies, session affinity handling, horizontal pod autoscaling, and inter-service communication patterns. It provides practical insights into building production-ready WebSocket infrastructure that can scale to millions of concurrent connections while maintaining reliability and performance.
