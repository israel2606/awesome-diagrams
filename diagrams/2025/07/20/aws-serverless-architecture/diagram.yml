  A serverless architecture demonstrating a three-tier approach using AWS services, where a static website hosted on S3 interacts with Lambda functions and DynamoDB to process user feedback, with services like API Gateway and CloudFront enabling scalable, event-driven interactions.

  The architecture shows interconnected AWS services representing presentation, logic, and data tiers in a serverless web application context, illustrating how modern cloud-native applications can be built without managing server infrastructure.
