  At the core of Gemini lies the Transformer architecture, a revolutionary neural network design specifically optimized for natural language processing tasks. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that process information sequentially, the Transformer employs a parallel approach, allowing it to analyze the entire context of a sentence simultaneously. This parallel processing significantly increases efficiency and accuracy, enabling Gemini to handle complex tasks with remarkable ease.

  The Transformer architecture consists of building blocks that work together to process and understand natural language, making it the foundation for powerful large language models like Google Gemini.
