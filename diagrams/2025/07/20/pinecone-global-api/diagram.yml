  We developed a new global control plane API â€” api.pinecone.io. The global API eliminates the need for per environment endpoints and allows users to access resources from multiple environments with the same API key.

  The architecture shows the evolution from regional API architecture with separate endpoints to a unified global API with control plane that manages resources across multiple cloud environments with low latency.
