description: A comprehensive data pipeline implementation using DuckDB for data processing, DBT for transformations with Medallion architecture (bronze → silver → gold), and Airflow 3 for orchestration. The architecture demonstrates modern ELT patterns, containerized deployment with Docker Compose, and includes the complete workflow from source data ingestion through data quality checks to final PostgreSQL loading.
